# Qt Backup Tool

This tool is inspired in a script I made using Bash which you can find in
[acgissues/backup-tool](https://github.com/acgissues/backup-tool) and is inteded
to be a PySide exercise for me. Yes, I wonder why would someone use a Qt based
program for such a simple task.

As soon as I started the project I streamed it via [my Twitch.tv
channel](https://twitch.tv/acgissues) and will try to continue streaming every
time I work on it.

There's also a list of pending changes that I want to get done in order to make
usage of more PySide features.

## To-do

- [  ] Add progress bar for backups.
- [  ] Let user specify destination directory.
- [  ] Add timestamps to tarfiles.
- [  ] Add menubar with 'About' and 'Quit' option.
- [  ] Center screen.

_There's no priority order for the former features that I want to add._
